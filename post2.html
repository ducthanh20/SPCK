        <div class="V">SW USA – The Best Road Trip Destinations</div>
        <div class="T1">This year, between June and October, we road tripped from California to Colorado four times and from Colorado to California five times. I spent over 200 hours in the car – with some combination of zero, one or two kids – and stayed at 18 hotels in five states.

            We took different routes every road trip. We were in no hurry and figured as long as we were traveling by car we should visit places we had never been before, explore new towns, and stop at as many National Parks as possible. In total we made 14 visits to six National Parks – returning to most of them multiple times in order to see more.
            
            Of everywhere we traveled throughout California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona and Colorado, these were the ten best road trip destinations we would recommend to other families. I should note that we drove through New Mexico twice but did not stop, as there was a 14-day quarantine requirement all summer.</div>

    <div class="T1">We loved Arches National Park and visited three times on our recent road trips. It’s simple to navigate and the hikes are great for short legs, and we found it easy to escape the crowds even on peak summer days simply by visiting early in the morning and late in the afternoon.</div>
